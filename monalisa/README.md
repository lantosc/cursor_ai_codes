# Chat with Mona Lisa

An interactive application that allows you to chat with the Mona Lisa painting using voice or text, with animated facial movements synchronized to speech.

## Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Speak to Mona Lisa using your microphone
- 💬 **Text Chat**: Type messages to have conversations
- 🤖 **AI Responses**: Intelligent responses from Mona Lisa (using OpenAI GPT or simple rule-based)
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech**: Mona Lisa responds with voice
- 🎭 **Facial Animation**: Mouth movements synchronized with speech
- 🎨 **Beautiful GUI**: Clean, intuitive interface

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A microphone (for voice input)
- Internet connection (for speech recognition and text-to-speech)
- Optional: OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com (for GPT-powered chat; separate from Cursor Pro)

## Installation

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. For PyAudio on Windows, if you encounter issues, try:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

3. Download a Mona Lisa image and save it as `mona_lisa.jpg` in the `monalisa` folder.
   - You can download one from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa#/media/File:Mona_Lisa,_by_Leonardo_da_Vinci,_from_C2RMF_retouched.jpg

4. (Optional) For GPT-powered chat, create a `.env` file in the `monalisa` folder (the app does not ship with one):
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Get an API key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (sign up or log in to OpenAI)
   - Put your key in `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
   - **Note:** Cursor Pro does not include OpenAI API access; you need a separate OpenAI account and key for this.

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Using the Application

1. **Text Chat**: Type your message in the text box and press Enter or click "Send"
2. **Voice Chat**: Click the "🎤 Listen" button and speak your message
3. Watch Mona Lisa respond with animated facial movements and voice!

### Controls

- **Send Button**: Send typed messages
- **🎤 Listen Button**: Activate voice input
- **Enter Key**: Quick send for typed messages

```

## How It Works

1. **Speech Recognition**: Uses Google Speech Recognition API to convert your voice to text
2. **AI Chat**: Processes your message and generates a response (OpenAI GPT or rule-based)
3. **Text-to-Speech**: Converts Mona Lisa's response to audio using Google Text-to-Speech
4. **Face Animation**: Uses MediaPipe to detect facial landmarks and animates the mouth based on audio

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues
- Make sure your microphone is connected and enabled
- Check microphone permissions in your system settings
- Try adjusting microphone input levels

### Animation Not Working
- Ensure `mona_lisa.jpg` exists in the monalisa folder
- The image should clearly show a face (MediaPipe needs to detect facial landmarks)
- Try a higher resolution image

### Speech Recognition Errors
- Check your internet connection (uses Google Speech Recognition API)
- Try speaking more clearly or in a quieter environment
- Increase the timeout in `speech_recognition_module.py` if needed

### OpenAI / GPT chat not working
- The app uses **OpenAI’s API** (platform.openai.com), not Cursor. Cursor Pro does not provide an OpenAI API key.
- Create a `.env` file in the `monalisa` folder (copy from `.env.example`) and set `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key`.
- Get a key at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys (OpenAI account and billing may be required).
- If the key is missing or invalid, the app falls back to rule-based responses.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] More sophisticated lip-sync using audio analysis
- [ ] Better facial expression animations
- [ ] Support for multiple languages
- [ ] Save conversation history
- [ ] More advanced animation techniques (e.g., Wav2Lip integration)
